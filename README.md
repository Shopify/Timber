Shopify Timber
=====================

Timber is a theme framework for Shopify that helps you get your store up and running quickly. It provides all required theme templates, a starter set of liquid tags, and basic styles and modules for you to extend.

Styling and customization is left up to you. Some base styles and helpers are included, but there is **no need to remove any code before you start**. Simply download and begin designing.

Three Ways to Get Started
---------------------
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Shopify/Timber/releases)
2. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Shopify/Timber.git`
3. Or install with [Bower](http://bower.io/) `bower install timber`

Setup with Grunt
---------------------
Grunt is an optional layer for developing with Timber. To setup Grunt for Timber development, follow these steps.

__Requirements__: [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (and Ruby 1.9+ on Windows).

If you don't want to use Grunt, simply ignore the `src/` folder and edit the files founds in `assets/`.

1. Navigate to your local Timber files in Terminal
2. Install Grunt globally
<small>You may need to preface the command below with `sudo` to use proper permissions</small>

        $ npm install -g grunt-cli

3. Install required packages

        $ npm install

4. Bundle dependencies

        $ bundle install

5. Insert private app keys

  Add your private app keys to `grunt-config-sample.json` and rename file to `grunt-config.json`. [Learn to make a private app](http://docs.shopify.com/api/authentication/creating-a-private-app).

### Grunt Tasks
`$ grunt`
- Default task
- Watches `src/stylesheets/` folder and concatenates styles into `assets/timber.scss.liquid`
- Automatically compresses image files in `assets/`
- Uploads valid theme from the root folder to your store

----------

`$ grunt build`
- Concatenates stylesheets and compresses images
- Files are not uploaded

----------

`$ grunt deploy`
- Concatenates stylesheets, compresses images, and uploads all theme files to your shop
- Note, this will overwrite all files (including active settings) so use sparingly
  - To upload all files except your settings_data.json, use `grunt shopify:upload --no-json` (TODO: not working. would be nice to have `grunt deploy --no-json`)

----------

`$ grunt zip`
- Concatenates stylesheets, compresses images, and creates a zip file with only the valid theme files
